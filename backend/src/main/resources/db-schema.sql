-- Database Schema for TastyFood
-- This file contains the table creation statements
-- Run this before inserting data from postgres_inserts.sql

-- Note: Adjust data types as needed for PostgreSQL
-- This is a template - you may need to adjust based on your actual domain models

-- Example table structure (you'll need to create all tables based on your entities)
-- Refer to your JPA entities for exact column definitions

-- For now, you can use Hibernate to generate the schema by setting:
-- spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
-- (temporarily, then set back to 'none' after first run)

-- Or manually create tables based on your domain models:
-- - employees
-- - login_credentials  
-- - drivers
-- - item_categories
-- - menu_items
-- - delivery_address
-- - orders
-- - order_items
